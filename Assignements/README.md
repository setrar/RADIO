You may have heard the terms FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) vs TDD (Time Division Duplex). These refer to different ways of sending and receiving information. Both use radio frequencies to do so, and both work with LTE and 5G. One, FDD, is more often used in modern cellular technologies for several reasons. Some cell phone signal boosters can make use of both TDD and FDD, like the Asia/Oceania exclusive Cel-Fi Go G41. What are the differences between them? Is one better than the other? Why does 5G need both technologies to work properly?

What are TDD and FDD?

TDD stands for Time Division Duplex. It is a means of communication using one frequency to send and receive information. The packages are separated by a small amount of time. The user (your cell phone) and the base station (the cell tower) communicate on one channel or frequency with different time slots for both uplink and downlink transmissions.

FDD stands for Frequency Division Duplex. It is a means of communication that uses two frequencies to send and receive information. The packages are separated by a buffer or guard frequency.The user (your cell phone) and the base station (the cell tower) communicate on two channels or frequencies one for each uplink and downlink transmission. This is called a paired frequency.
