    "### AT Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AT+CFUN` command controls the functionality level of a modem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`AT+CFUN=0`**: Sets the modem to minimum functionality mode, conserving power by disabling most functions and network connectivity.\n",
    "2. **`AT+CFUN=1`**: Sets the modem to full functionality mode, enabling all functions and network connectivity for normal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AT command `AT+COPS=?` is used to query the available network operators in the vicinity of a mobile device. This command is part of the AT command set, which is used for controlling modems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send the `AT+COPS=?` command to a modem, it performs a network scan and returns a list of all the available operators that the device can see. The response includes information about each operator, typically formatted as a list of operator names or codes along with the type of network (e.g., GSM, UMTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general response format might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "+COPS: (1,\"Operator1\",\"Operator1\",\"12345\",7),(2,\"Operator2\",\"Operator2\",\"23456\",0),...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this response:\n",
    "- Each set of parentheses represents a different operator.\n",
    "- The first number in each set indicates the status of the operator (e.g., whether it is currently available or not).\n",
    "- The first string is the long alphanumeric name of the operator.\n",
    "- The second string is the short alphanumeric name of the operator.\n",
    "- The third string is the numeric code (MCC and MNC) of the operator.\n",
    "- The final number indicates the type of network (e.g., GSM, UMTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a more detailed breakdown of a typical response entry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(1, \"Operator1\", \"Operator1\", \"12345\", 7)**\n",
    "  - `1`: Indicates the status of the operator (e.g., 1 might mean available, 2 might mean currently registered, etc.).\n",
    "  - `\"Operator1\"`: Long alphanumeric name of the operator.\n",
    "  - `\"Operator1\"`: Short alphanumeric name of the operator.\n",
    "  - `\"12345\"`: Numeric code representing the operator's Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC).\n",
    "  - `7`: Type of network (e.g., 0 = GSM, 7 = LTE, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different devices and firmware versions might provide slightly different response formats, but the general structure will be similar. This command is particularly useful for applications that need to manage network connectivity dynamically, such as roaming scenarios or selecting between different operators manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AT command `AT+QNWPREFCFG=\"nr5g_band,41:77:78\"` is used to configure the preferred NR (New Radio, also known as 5G) frequency bands for a modem. This command is part of the extended AT command set provided by certain modem manufacturers, such as Quectel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the command and its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AT+QNWPREFCFG`: This is the command prefix used to configure network preferences.\n",
    "- `\"nr5g_band\"`: This parameter specifies that the configuration is for NR (5G) frequency bands.\n",
    "- `41:77:78`: These are the specific NR frequency bands being configured as preferred bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each band number corresponds to a specific frequency range used for 5G communications. Here’s what the bands represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Band 41**: This is a Time Division Duplex (TDD) band used for LTE and NR. It operates in the frequency range of approximately 2496 to 2690 MHz.\n",
    "- **Band 77**: This is a TDD band used exclusively for NR. It operates in the frequency range of approximately 3300 to 4200 MHz.\n",
    "- **Band 78**: This is another TDD band used for NR. It operates in the frequency range of approximately 3300 to 3800 MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "By sending this command, you are instructing the modem to prefer connecting to 5G networks using these specified bands (41, 77, and 78). This can be useful in scenarios where certain bands provide better coverage, capacity, or performance in a given area. \n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration might be used to optimize the modem’s connectivity based on the network conditions and the available bands supported by the network operators in the region where the device is being used."

    "The TDD slot configuration with the following sequence: \"D D D F U.\" Let's break down this configuration in the context of the TDD frame and the 4:1 DL/UL ratio mentioned earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TDD Slot Configuration**:\n",
    "   - **D**: Downlink slot\n",
    "   - **F**: Flexible slot\n",
    "   - **U**: Uplink slot\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slot Breakdown**:\n",
    "   - **D D D**: Three consecutive downlink slots.\n",
    "   - **F**: One flexible slot, which can be used either for downlink, uplink, or special subframe depending on the configuration and need.\n",
    "   - **U**: One uplink slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relation to the 4:1 DL/UL Ratio**:\n",
    "   - In the provided configuration, out of the 5 main slots (D D D F U), we see:\n",
    "     - 3 slots are dedicated to downlink (D).\n",
    "     - 1 slot is dedicated to uplink (U).\n",
    "     - 1 slot is flexible (F), which can be used to balance the needs between downlink and uplink dynamically.\n",
    "   - Considering the flexible slot can potentially be used as a downlink slot, this configuration aligns with a 4:1 ratio. This means up to 4 slots (D D D F) could be used for downlink, and 1 slot (U) for uplink.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Operational Use**:\n",
    "   - This configuration shows a typical TDD setup where the majority of the slots are allocated for downlink to cater to higher downlink data demands.\n",
    "   - The flexible slot provides versatility, allowing the network to adapt to varying traffic conditions by adjusting its use as needed for downlink, uplink, or special subframe purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the image exemplifies a TDD slot configuration that effectively implements a 4:1 DL/UL ratio, where the majority of slots are used for downlink, with one slot specifically for uplink, and one slot flexible for dynamic use."
