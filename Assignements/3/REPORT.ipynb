    "### Issues Identified and Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Pilot-based Channel Estimation:**\n",
    "- **Issue:** Current channel estimation relies heavily on pilot symbols, assuming perfect recovery.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Implement robust channel estimation techniques (e.g., MMSE, LS) with improved pilot pattern design to mitigate errors due to imperfect pilot recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Combining and Normalization:**\n",
    "- **Issue:** Repetition combining (`y = combEnabled*y + yr;`) and normalization (`y_norm = y/r;`) methods may degrade signal quality depending on `combEnabled` and `R`.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Optimize repetition combining strategies and ensure appropriate normalization to enhance received signal quality without introducing distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. CFO Compensation:**\n",
    "- **Issue:** Current CFO compensation may not handle high CFO values or varying SNR conditions effectively (`cfoPhaseRamp` calculation).\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Implement robust CFO estimation and compensation techniques (e.g., Schmidl & Cox method) to accurately recover symbols without rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Signal Distortion and STO Handling:**\n",
    "- **Issue:** Management of `stoError` and `cpLength` for STO and CP handling could lead to symbol distortion during FFT/IFFT operations.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Ensure proper STO and CP handling to prevent symbol overlap or loss, using adequate guard intervals and synchronization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. EVM Calculation:**\n",
    "- **Issue:** Lack of explicit EVM calculation (`sqrt(sum(abs(x - x_est).^2) / sum(abs(x).^2)) * 100`) to monitor demodulated symbol quality.\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Implement rigorous EVM monitoring post-demodulation to ensure decoded symbols meet the target criterion (50%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "By addressing these recommendations‚Äîenhancing channel estimation, improving CFO compensation, optimizing STO and CP handling, monitoring EVM, and conducting comprehensive simulations‚Äîthe OFDM receiver can achieve robust performance across various SNR and repetition conditions, ensuring successful decoding and reliable operation in practical scenarios."
