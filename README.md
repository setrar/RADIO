Course description
This course treats the subject of modern radio engineering and includes typical RF architectures and their characterizations, modeling, prediction and simulation of radio-wave propagation, cellular planning, systems-level aspects of modern radio network design.
Three practical lab sessions using typical RF equipment and measurement tools are offered.
RF systems : RF architectures for base-stations and mobile terminals, amplifiers and noise figure, receiver sensitivity, emission masks non-linear characterization of RF components.
Propagation Modelling and Simulation : Models for path loss, shadowing, multipath propagation. Statistical characterizations. Time and frequency-selective properties of radio transmission, prediction tools.
Cellular Architectures : Link budget analysis, cellular coverage, duplexing strategies, multiple-access methods, network topologies, hand-over strategies.
Course notes
The course will be based on part I and part II of the book "Wireless Communications" by Andreas Molisch (3rd edition, IEEE Press 2022).

Also check out http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=1119117208&bcsId=12347 for additional material. Solutions to the exercises in the book can be found File link : [datas/teaching/courses/RADIO/solutions/Solutions_manual.pdf](solutions/Solutions_manual.pdf).

Supplementary reading: Simon Saunders, "Antennas and Propagation for Wireless Communication Systems", Wiley 1999.

Useful papers used during the course can be found in the documents section.

Watch this space for more material being published during the course.

Prerequisites
An understanding of probability theory, random processes, and digital communications.

Some knowledge of Matlab is also beneficial for the lab sessions.

Grading
The better of the following two methods will be applied

- Lab sessions & Quizzes: 25%, Mid-term exam: 25%, Final exam: 50%
- Lab sessions & Quizzes: 25%, Final exam: 75%
- Both Lab sessions and Final result must have at least 10 points (50%)

Exam rules
The mid-term will be open book (Book Molisch + course handouts only!). Duration: 1h.

The final exam will be closed book. Only one A4 sheet (back&front) with hand-written notes is allowed. Duration: 2h

Both exams will be carried out on moodle using the Safe Exam Browser (https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Safe_Exam_Browser). For those who can't or don't want to use their personal laptops for this will use the LAB PCs.

Don't forget your calculator.

Labs
See syllabus above for timetable and assignments
Exercises will be solved during lab session.
The attendance to the lab sessions is compulsory. If you cannot attend a lab session, you have to inform me beforehand providing a proof that you cannot attend (e.g. flight reservation).
Additionally, you may work on the assignments also at home
Final report due one week after final lab session
Data and code required for lab session is in the documents folder
Past exams
Past exams can be found in the documents section.
